# Smart-Data-Entry-System
The evolution of intelligent document processing has seen a convergence of technologies
from Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and usercentric interface design. The shift from passive text digitization to active document interaction
has gained attention due to growing demands for efficiency, accuracy, and automation in
document-driven workflows. In domains such as education, legal services, administration, and
healthcare, users are increasingly dependent on systems that can not only extract textual data
from various formats but also provide intelligent responses to context-specific queries.
This chapter presents a detailed review of the state-of-the-art technologies relevant to document
extraction, local language modelling , and conversational user interfaces. Each section critically
analyses the methodologies, capabilities, and limitations of current systems and frameworks.
The objective is to establish the technological gaps that motivate the proposed Smart Document
Assistant an offline, secure, and interactive solution integrating OCR and local LLM-based
querying with dynamic user interaction.

document content efficiently has become essential across sectors such as education, healthcare,
finance, and governance. While existing tools for document analysis and question answering rely
heavily on cloud-based infrastructures, they often introduce concerns regarding data privacy,
internet dependency, and latency. This research presents the design and development of the Smart
Document Assistant, an offline, intelligent system that enables users to upload documents in various
formats including PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, PNG, and JPEG and interact with their contents using
natural language queries. The proposed system integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
using Tesseract for image-based documents and supports multilingual extraction. It leverages local
Large Language Models (LLMs) via the OLLAMA framework for contextual understanding and
real-time question answering. A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows for dynamic
interaction, query-based keyword highlighting, and chat-style responses. The system supports secure
offline execution, ensuring privacy while maintaining high accuracy, low latency, and broad format
compatibility. Performance evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates that the Smart
Document Assistant delivers superior OCR accuracy (92.3% on clean documents), fast response
time (~1.2 seconds), and highly relevant answers (91.2%), all without requiring internet access. This
makes the system ideal for use in air-gapped environments or privacy-sensitive domains. The
modular architecture further enables scalability and future integration of voice input, database
connectivity, and advanced layout understanding, positioning the solution as a robust platform for
document intelligence.
